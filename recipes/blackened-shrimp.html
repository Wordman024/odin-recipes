            The simplest and best way to blacken fresh shrimp.
        </h3>
            <p>
                This recipe focuses mainly on a cooking technique called a "dredge", which can be applied to any recipe in which you desire a blackened meat. Growing up in the southern US I always loved eating at local fish camps, and they always had the best blackened shrimp - tender, perfectly cooked shrimp with a crispy outer coating of blackened seasoning. Before I cooked professionally I always wondered how they got that delicious crispy coating of seasoning. Then I found the secret! They used a "dredge"!

                This "dredge" is simply an oil and dry spice mixture which creates an oily paste-like constincency and allows the spices to stick well to the meat, thus forming that amazing crunchy coating when cooked over high heat. This recipe is super easy and I use it all the time to make delicious blackened shrimp for pastas or tacos.

                <em><strong>Caution!!!</strong> Blackening anything will create lots of smoke! Put the exhaust van above your stove on high or open windows.</em>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 lbs fresh shrimp
                </li>
                <li>
                    peanut oil
                </li>
                <li>
                    dry spice blend of your choice
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a small or medium bowl add a 1/2 cup of the dry spice blend.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    Slowly pour peanut oil over the spice blend while stirring with a tablespoon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue adding oil and stirring until mixture is an oily paste-like consistency. It should fall off the spoon easily. It should not be a thick paste.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After creating the dredge, dip the peeled and deveined shrimp into it, fully coating both sides. If you run out of dredge mixture you can easily make more as you go. Set the shrimp aside on a plate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set two saute' pans on the stove over med-high heat. Get the pans hot!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the pans are hot, carefully add shrimp to the pans in one layer. Do not move the shrimp! This is where the magic takes place and the seasoning blackens and forms that beautiful crust. Cook for 2 minutes and then flip over each shrimp. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue cooking for 1-2 minutes and remove shrimp from pans.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
        <p>
            You should now have perfectly blackened shrimp with a nice firm crust of seasoning, and probably a smokey house.
